My personal collection of bash scripts that install Arch Linux
to use:

1. download the latest Arch Installation disk from https://archlinux.org/download/
2. create a bootable medium so the Arch ISO can be booted. I recommennd a usb disk made with Ventoy, balena edtcher, or Rufus
   https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy
   https://github.com/balena-io/etcher
   https://github.com/pbatard/rufus
3. once in the Arch live environment set up networking. The environment automatically sets up wired connnenctions but wireless connnections require manual setup.
   reference here for how to connect using iwctl.
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#iwctl
4. once connected install git
   pacman -S git
5. clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/GinsengGhoul/ArchInstall-bash
6. cd into the directory
   cd ArchInstall-bash
7. edit the Configuration.cfg file to your liking before running the scripts on numerical order
